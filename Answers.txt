Question 3

What is one question that the dashboard can answer by utilizing two or more simultaneously displayed charts?

What is the answer?

How do these two charts indicate the answer?

Please carefully and completely answer all three questions, and especially how the combination of both charts 
provides the answer to the observer's question. Make sure the question that the two charts answer requires both charts, 
and is a reasonable question that hasn't been ridiculously contrived for this assignment.
