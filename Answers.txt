Question 3

What is one question that the dashboard can answer by utilizing two or more simultaneously displayed charts?
Do counties in California with a larger Percentage of Adults with Bachelors Degree or Higher geographically cluster together and create pockets of counties with higher than average fiscal earnings compared with the rest of the state?


What is the answer?
Yes we can see this trend over the decade of 2013 to 2023.


How do these two charts indicate the answer?




Please carefully and completely answer all three questions, and especially how the combination of both charts 
provides the answer to the observer's question. Make sure the question that the two charts answer requires both charts, 
and is a reasonable question that hasn't been ridiculously contrived for this assignment.

Question 8

How does your dashboard support cross-filtering between these two charts? The cross filtering must be bi-directional, such that a selection made in the first chart is reflected in the second chart, and a selection made in the second chart is reflected in the first chart.
